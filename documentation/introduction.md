Introduction
============

Ghosts are recordings of user activity on a web site,
later replayed on the same page to the owner of the web site.

Rationale: short and extensible
-------------------------------

The data format shall be concise to reduce bandwidth and extensible
to allow the recording of new types of interactions in future versions
of the ghost recorder while being able to replay both old and new
recordings in the ghost player.
