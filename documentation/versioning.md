Semantic Versioning
-------------------

The version numbers follow the [Semantic Versioning Specification][SEMVER].

The major, minor and patch version are represented here as three separate
integers rather than a string.

According to Semantic Versioning, no backward compatibility shall be expected
while the major version number is 0: recorders and players developed during
this time may be compatible with a single version of the format.
